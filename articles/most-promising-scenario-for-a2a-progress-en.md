A2A Protocol Rollout Senario ‚Äî Predictions Based on Concrete Evidence

## Quick Summary

* Unlike the community-driven development of the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction), **the practical rollout of the [A2A (Agent-to-Agent) Protocol](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/a2a-a-new-era-of-agent-interoperability) will really accelerate once successful enterprise PoC cases emerge via system integrators (SIers).**
* The fastest path to commercial agent-to-agent communication is via [AWS Bedrock Agents](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/) (since it is self-contained within AWS Cloud).
* At the same time, the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/openai-launches-new-tools-to-help-businesses-build-ai-agents/) will drive a proliferation of SaaS integrations and PoCs.
* In the first half of 2026, **A2A General Availability in [Microsoft Copilot Studio](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/microsoft-copilot-studio) and [Salesforce Agentforce](https://www.salesforce.com/jp/agentforce/), changing the landscape.**
* From the second half of 2026 onward, **cross-cloud requirements** will become prominent, and **A2A‚Äôs ability to seamlessly integrate with existing enterprise infrastructure, security, and governance capabilities** will give it the advantage.
* Based on the evidence, **the fastest to deliver cross-cloud A2A integration will be combination of Microsoft + SAP / Salesforce + Accenture / Deloitte / PwC**

Below, I‚Äôll examine this A2A progress scenario in detail, drawing on concrete pieces of evidence.

![robots-at-a-table](/images/most-promising-scenario-for-a2a-progress/robots-at-table.png)

## Why Agent-to-Agent Communication Is Inevitable

* Many SaaS products are‚Äîor will be‚Äîreplaced by ‚ÄúAgent as a Service.‚Äù Major SaaS vendors have already begun building agent layers.
* In the future, tasks currently performed by humans, such as accessing internal company data and using a SaaS accounting web application, will be completely handed off to an "Accounting Processing Agent."
* When a company needs to coordinate between Salesforce (CRM) and SAP (ERP), employees will simply delegate the job to their internal AI assistant (agent). That agent will then communicate with the Salesforce and SAP agents to get the work done.
* In such a world, Agent-to-Agent communication becomes essential. Enterprise governance is initially a high barrier, but **A2A significantly mitigates these challenges** (see below).

## Why A2A Will Not Evolve Community-Driven Like MCP

* With MCP, the minimum viable elements‚Äîopen spec, a local MCP Server, and ready-to-use clients (e.g., Claude for Desktop, IDE plugins)‚Äîwere available from day one, giving you instant payoff and fueling community adoption.
* A2A today lacks a generic A2A client and any GUI client that end users can directly interact with.
* Implementation is primarily focused on local A2A Servers, offering little advantage over MCP.
* In short, **without the ‚Äúinstant convenience‚Äù of a GUI client and a cloud-hosted generic server, community-driven growth is difficult.**

## Why Collaboration Among Microsoft, SAP, and Salesforce Is the Most Likely Path to A2A Adoption

* Realizing cross-company agent collaboration requires meeting enterprise governance needs‚Äîespecially audit and responsibility demarcation‚Äîfor cross-cloud scenarios.
* Based on the evidence, the Microsoft + SAP + Salesforce combination appears most likely to reach ‚Äúproduction readiness,‚Äù so we‚Äôll dive deeper around these three.

### PoC and Technical Stack Alignment in Progress

* Microsoft‚ÄìSAP and Microsoft‚ÄìSalesforce proofs of concept are already in motion.
* The Joule‚ÄìCopilot demo can be extended by swapping in A2A under the hood.
* The Microsoft‚ÄìSalesforce Bot Framework integration can transition by replacing endpoints once the A2A SDK goes GA.
* **We expect many ‚Äútwo-vendor + SIer‚Äù PoCs through 2025, leading to ‚Äúcross-cloud ecosystem PoCs‚Äù surfacing around 2026.**

### Summary of This Section

* The shortest path to multi-vendor agent collaboration across Microsoft, SAP, and Salesforce appears to lie with ‚Äúproduction-line‚Äù SIers: Accenture, Deloitte, and PwC.
* Capgemini, Wipro, and IBM are also mass-producing PoCs with industry templates and hybrid platforms; by late 2025, cross-cloud PoCs are likely to surface.
* All SIers have begun adopting architectures built on A2A and the Task Lifecycle API. It‚Äôs reasonable to expect real commercial use cases that seamlessly hand off tasks between Copilot, Joule, and Agentforce in 2026.

## Why Are ‚ÄúProduction-Line‚Äù SIers Such as Accenture / Deloitte / PwC Most Likely to Realize A2A Agent Collaboration First?

* For each global SI/consulting firm, we prioritized potential PoC candidates based on news releases, case studies, industry templates featuring specific companies, and major contracts that technically enable Microsoft-SAP-Salesforce collaboration.
* Whether these candidate companies are actually running official PoCs using A2A/A3A protocols has not been publicly disclosed‚Äîplease read this as an informed hypothesis based on publicly available information.

* All of Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, and SAP are recruiting PoC partners via early access, partner programs, hackathons, and EACs.
* Major SIers like Accenture explicitly outline roadmaps to deploy with customers first and then scale.
* All six SIers have publicly or semi-publicly invited PoC participation through accelerators, early access, hackathons, demo slots, and partner programs.
* These findings are based on primary sources (official websites, blogs, LinkedIn posts, press releases), giving them high credibility.
* Therefore, there is ample evidence to support the view that enterprises and SIers will lead the A2A/multi-agent wave.

## Why Will A2A‚Äôs Multi-Cloud Approach Gain the Advantage Once Cross-Cloud Requirements Emerge?

* First, compare A2A vs. competing protocols on time to reach practical production.
* Based on that, consider the scenario for reaching a ‚Äúproduction‚Äù phase and A2A‚Äôs prospects.

### Practical Phase Scenarios

1. **Short-term (~ through Q4 2025)**  
   * The fastest to commercialize is **AWS Bedrock Agents** (self-contained within AWS Cloud). AWS announced [‚ÄúStrands Agents‚Äù](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-strands-agents-an-open-source-ai-agents-sdk/) in May 2025 and will soon add A2A protocol support.  
   * The [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/openai-launches-new-tools-to-help-businesses-build-ai-agents/) will drive a surge of SaaS integrations and PoCs, eliciting real-world developer feedback.

2. **Mid-term (2026 H1)**  
   * **A2A** will reach GA in Microsoft Copilot Studio and Salesforce Agentforce ‚Üí first core-business PoCs will debut.  
   * The **LangChain Agent Protocol** will be embedded in OSS PaaS, aiming to become the ‚Äústartup standard.‚Äù

3. **Long-term (2026 H2+)**  
   * **Cross-cloud requirements** (audit, responsibility demarcation, latency) will become critical ‚Üí **A2A‚Äôs ability to seamlessly integrate with existing enterprise infrastructure and security/governance features** will prevail.

### A2A Could Establish an Advantage Through Cross-Cloud + Enterprise Infrastructure

* **A2A‚Äôs strengths** are its open specification and its ability to leverage existing enterprise security, monitoring, governance, and identity management frameworks‚Äîno one else has a comprehensive set of guidelines for audit and identity management.  
  * The protocol behaves as a standard HTTP-based enterprise application rather than introducing a new proprietary format, enabling enterprises to reuse their existing tools seamlessly.  
* However, its developer experience‚Äîbeing able to ‚Äúget something up and running immediately‚Äù‚Äîis weaker, so AWS/OpenAI currently lead the developer ecosystem.  
* The decisive factor will be whether SIers can deliver enterprise-grade production use cases first.  
* If a Microsoft-SAP-Salesforce PoC goes GA in 2026 H1, the standardization phase could accelerate rapidly.  
* Ultimately, it‚Äôs a battle of **‚ÄúAWS/OpenAI: closed and fast‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúA2A: open and heavyweight.‚Äù** A2A must showcase real production scenarios that only enterprises can provide‚Äîand that is precisely the scenario SIers are moving to execute now.

## Conclusion

Above is a concise summary (as concise as possible, but still quite lengthy‚Ä¶) of my exploration into A2A trends using ChatGPT. If there are any misunderstandings or unclear points, please feel free to comment üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. If you found any of this helpful, I‚Äôd be delighted üòÄ

#### Note: What I Learned About Using AI for Research This Time

In the past, I used ChatGPT‚Äôs Deep Research to gather a wide range of information‚Äîincluding consulting reports‚Äîdigest it, and create a report. While such reports are educational, I felt they often lacked a certain spark of novelty.

> It‚Äôs obvious if you think about it: feed too much information, and sharp insights get buried among common opinions. If you asked for ‚Äúa compilation of cutting-edge viewpoints unique to specific sources,‚Äù you might see a different landscape.

This time, I began with the intuition that for AI Agents to become practical, we need to pursue feasibility across multiple companies. With that idea, I formulated hypotheses and used o3 to dive deep, relying on situational evidence as the primary basis. I think this resulted in a report that has a bit more of that spark of interest (I hope you think so too‚Ä¶).

That said, the key to leveraging AI is how you frame the question: when you ask questions anyone might think of, you often get a mundane answer. But o3 is surprisingly powerful: if you tell it to go into full brainstorming mode and think leaps ahead, it can offer remarkably interesting perspectives. It might be closer than you think to the level where you can just leave everything up to it‚Ä¶
